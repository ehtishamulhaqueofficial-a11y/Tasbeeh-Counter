🕋 **Tasbeeh Counter – Version 3**

A simple yet powerful web-based Tasbeeh Counter built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This app helps users easily create, manage, and track multiple tasbeehs (zikr) with live counting and data persistence.

🌟 Features

✅ Add New Tasbeehs
Create and name your own tasbeeh (e.g., SubhanAllah, Alhamdulillah) and start counting instantly.

✅ Dynamic Counter Controls
Increase, decrease, or reset your tasbeeh count using intuitive buttons.

✅ Highlight Active Tasbeeh
Select a tasbeeh box to make it active and perform count updates only on the selected one.

✅ Delete Option
Easily remove unwanted tasbeehs with a modern delete icon (🗑️).

✅ Auto Save (Local Storage)
Your tasbeehs and counts are automatically saved — even after you refresh or close the browser.

✅ Clean & Minimal UI
A smooth, modern, and easy-to-understand interface designed for simplicity and focus.

🧠 How It Works

Each tasbeeh you add is stored in the browser’s localStorage, so your data never disappears until you delete it.

When the page loads, the app automatically loads saved tasbeehs and displays them on screen.

You can increase, decrease, or reset the count for the selected tasbeeh.

Every change is saved instantly for next time.

🖥️ Responsiveness

⚠️ Important Note:
Currently, this web app is optimized only for desktop and laptop screens.
Mobile responsiveness will be added in a future update (Version 4).

🚀 Future Improvements (Planned for Version 4)

✅ Add target goal for each tasbeeh (e.g., 100, 500, etc.)

✅ Show a completion popup or alarm when the goal is reached

✅ Add a checkbox feature to mark tasbeehs as completed (with strikethrough effect)

✅ Improve mobile responsiveness and design aesthetics

💡 Inspiration
